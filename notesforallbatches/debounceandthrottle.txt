Debouncing in JavaScript
What is Debouncing?

Debouncing means:
👉 Execute a function only after a certain delay once the user stops triggering the event.

If the button is clicked multiple times quickly, the function runs only once after the delay.

Requirement

1. Show "Button Pressed: X" → increases on every click
2. Show "Triggered: Y" → increases only after 800ms debounce

UI Text (for understanding)


Button Pressed: 0
Triggered: 0

JavaScript Code (Debounce without Lodash)

let pressedCount = 0;
let triggeredCount = 0;

const button = document.getElementById("btn");
const pressedText = document.getElementById("pressed");
const triggeredText = document.getElementById("triggered");

function debounce(func, delay) {
    let timer;
    return function () {
        clearTimeout(timer);
        timer = setTimeout(() => {
            func();
        }, delay);
    };
}

const debouncedFunction = debounce(() => {
    triggeredCount++;
    triggeredText.innerText = "Triggered: " + triggeredCount;
}, 800);

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
    pressedCount++;
    pressedText.innerText = "Button Pressed: " + pressedCount;
    debouncedFunction();
});




How It Works (Explain to Students)

1. Every time the button is clicked
   → Button Pressed count increases

2. The debounce function:

    Clears the previous timer
    Starts a new 800ms timer

3. If clicks keep happening
   → Function does NOT run

4. When user stops clicking for 800ms
   → Triggered count increases by 1



Example Output Scenario


User clicks button 7 times quickly



Button Pressed: 7
Triggered: 1   (after 800ms)




Key One-Line Definition (Very Important)


Debounce executes the function only after the event stops for a given delay.


Throttling in JavaScript (Button Example)


What is Throttling?

Throttling means:
👉 Execute a function at most once in a fixed time interval, no matter how many times the event occurs.

If the button is clicked continuously, the function runs only once every 800ms.


Requirement

1. Show "Button Pressed: X" → increases on every click
2. Show "Triggered: Y" → increases once every 800ms


UI Text (for understanding)


Button Pressed: 0
Triggered: 0



JavaScript Code (Throttle without Lodash)


let pressedCount = 0;
let triggeredCount = 0;

const button = document.getElementById("btn");
const pressedText = document.getElementById("pressed");
const triggeredText = document.getElementById("triggered");

function throttle(func, delay) {
    let lastTime = 0;
    return function () {
        const currentTime = Date.now();
        if (currentTime - lastTime >= delay) {
            lastTime = currentTime;
            func();
        }
    };
}

const throttledFunction = throttle(() => {
    triggeredCount++;
    triggeredText.innerText = "Triggered: " + triggeredCount;
}, 800);

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
    pressedCount++;
    pressedText.innerText = "Button Pressed: " + pressedCount;
    throttledFunction();
});



How It Works

1. Every button click
   → Button Pressed count increases

2. Throttle checks:

    Has 800ms passed since last execution?

3. If YES
   → Function executes
   → Triggered count increases

4. If NO
   → Function is ignored


Example Output Scenario


User clicks button 10 times continuously



Button Pressed: 10
Triggered: 3   (runs once every 800ms)



One-Line Definition (Important)


Throttle executes a function at regular intervals while the event is firing.



Final Difference


Debounce → Wait → Then Execute
Throttle → Execute → Then Wait
