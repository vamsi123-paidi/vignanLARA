What is a Closure?
A closure is created when a function "remembers" its lexical scope, even when that function is executed outside of its original scope.

Put simply:

A function inside another function can still access the outer function's variables, even after the outer function has finished running.

Closures in JavaScript are extremely powerful and widely used. Here are some  practical use cases of closures along with explanations:


function outer() {
  let count = 0;//hoisted at here
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2

Real-World Use Cases of Closures
 Data Privacy / Encapsulation
You can hide variables from the global scope.

function secretHolder() {
  let secret = "hidden";
  return {
    getSecret: () => secret,
    setSecret: (val) => { secret = val; }
  };
}

const x = secretHolder();
console.log(x.getSecret()); // "hidden"
x.setSecret("new secret");
console.log(x.getSecret()); // "new secret"

2. Creating Private Counters

function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    return ++count;
  };
}

const counterA = createCounter();
console.log(counterA()); // 1
console.log(counterA()); // 2
